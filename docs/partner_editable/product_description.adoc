The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deploys a collection of software that you can use, mostly through web-based interactions, to plan and operate small satellites (SmallSats and CubeSats). You can also use this software to control other instruments used in space missions, such as ____.

//TODO Andrew, Please fill in the blank.

AIT is a Python-based software suite that handles a ground data system (GDS) and electronic ground-support equipment (EGSE). It also handles commanding, telemetry uplink and downlink, sequencing for the JPL International Space Station (ISS), and CubeSat missions. It's an expansion of tools that NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed for its spacecraft missions.

Open MCT is a generalizable, open-source data-visualization framework that NASA's Ames Research Center developed to analyze telemetry data. It provides dashboards for desktop and mobile devices. NASA uses Open MCT to analyze data from spacecraft missions and to plan and operate experimental rover systems. You can use Open MCT as the basis for building applications for planning, operating, and analyzing any system that produces telemetry data.

//TODO: @MF Replace or augment with official content from AIT Editor team when available
// ^ request is out for AIT Editor team, what's here is fine for now
AIT Editor is an extension to Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC) that's published on the VSC Marketplace. This extension reads in the same configuration files used by AIT to perform syntax checking and validation of the files. You use AIT Editor to generate and edit spacecraft command-sequence files.
